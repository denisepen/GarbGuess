-Determine which weather condition to use to determine the acceptable item of clothing.
  -look at weather API
  -nested attributes for weather? upper_temp, lower_temp, precipitation, cloud,
  clothing(nested attributes for clothes weather_category )

-Determine how to display weather  - temp, condition (cloud, sun, temp), precipitation
 -How many times do I want to hit the API?
 -Or only make fetch call when application starts?


Not as Important:
 -Work on clothing card display
 -Do we have a form to query all conditions at once?
  -ex: check box for rain/snow, temp input field, check box for event type (casual, work, formal)
