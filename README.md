# README
The purpose of this application is to help the user determine which clothes to wear depending on the weather. To begin using run 'rake db:migrate', 'rake db:seed', followed by 'rake start'. The application should open on localhost:3000.

Once the application has started type a weather condition into the search bar.

The front end was built  using React.
The back end was built using Rails

1st Iteration (current):
First choose a weather condition (rain, sun, mild) and type it into the search bar.  Based on this input a list of acceptable clothes will be pulled up.

Second Iteration:
the open weather api will be tapped and display the current weather.  Based on this data a list of acceptable clothing will appear.

Third Iteration:
Includes 2nd Iteration.  In addition, there will be the option to optimize based on color or type of event (casual, work, formal - in addition to taking the weather into consideration). Maybe utilize a card carousel.

Fourth Iteration:
